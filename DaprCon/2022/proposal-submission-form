# DaprCon 2022 Proposal Submission Form
DaprCon will be returning again for 2022! This year as part of CNCF, DaprCon will take place as part of KubeCon North America (NA) 2022. That said, we'd like the community's help - send us some presentation proposals with your unique Dapr scenarios, techical examples, and stories! We'll be accepting proposals from anyone in the Dapr community that's interested in presenting at DaprCon. 

If you're interested in participating as a speaker, fill out the [DaprCon 2022 Proposal Submission Form](https://forms.gle/5zB9ijtc8yx9vdJ68). We'll be reviewing submissions as they come in and will reach out via email if your proposal looks like a good fit.
