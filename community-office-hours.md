# Dapr Community Office Hours

We realize that getting feedback on your project publicly may not always be feasible therefore, in addition to the bi-weekly community calls, Dapr maintainers also set aside some time each week to be available to answer technical questions in a private forum. 

To accommodate maximum number of participants, this weekly two hour periods are deviled into 15 min sessions, during which Dapr maintainers are available to answer your questions. Also, to accommodate the increasingly global Dapr community, these times rotate each week between 08:00 and 16:00 Pacific Time on Wednesdays.

15 min is a short time so come prepared. Office hours are designed for ALL and are not limited to those who commit source code. Here are some ideas:

* Users asking for advice on a specific aspect of Dapr usage
* Contributors needing feedback on a feature proposal
* Operators needing to configure Dapr deployments in that special way

> This may also be a great time to give us demo of your internal Dapr app!

We look forward to seeing you there!
