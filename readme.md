## Introduction
The Distributed Application Runtime, Dapr, is a portable, serverless, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, stateless and stateful microservices that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Dapr codifies the best practices for building microservice applications into open, independent, building blocks that enable you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.

Visit [dapr.io](https://dapr.io) for information about Dapr.

## Dapr authors

## How can I get involved?

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with "Good First Issue" or the "Help Wanted" labels:

- [Dapr runtime repo](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [Dapr CLI repo](https://github.com/dapr/cli/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/dapr/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using Dapr.
