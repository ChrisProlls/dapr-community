#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr

I have worked on Dapr now for over a year and a half, contributing mostly to pluggable components and Dapr Workflows, from proposal to design and implementation as well as contributions to the project as a whole improving the proposal process, reviewing designs, and helping users. I currently serve as a member of the STC and manage a team at Microsoft that is responsible for contributing to Dapr and advancing its use within Azure.  


#### Why you are running

I believe that open source projects, such as Dapr, are fundamental to the way that we build software and services that power the things we build. Dapr empowers user to simplify their applications by reducing the overhead required to develop cloud-native applications. By providing a number of higher-order features such as workflows, actors and cryptography, Dapr is uniquely positioned to help developers with a number of complexities in building distributed systems by solving the problem once rather than forcing them to be re-implemented differently in every language. I think that providing solid implementations of common patterns found in distributed systems is something that we can all benefit from and would like to see continue to grow. 

Dapr, like a number of projects, benefits from the perspectives from many different users and contributors and to that end I hope to encourage a community where people feel like they can participate in the process. Be it submitting code, reviewing changes or designs, or making new feature proposals, I want to make sure that Dapr provides a welcoming environment for participants of many different backgrounds and organizations. 

In addition, I am interested in ensuring that Dapr's fundamentals are sound, and that developers have the best experience possible when learning, using and deploying Dapr-enabled applications. I believe it is important that we are able to continue to do the work needed to improve the way that we build, test, and release Dapr to the world. As well, I think it is important that we work to build documentation, tooling and resources to help developers onboard and learn to use Dapr as quickly as possible - through quality SDKs, CLI enhancements, and community support.
