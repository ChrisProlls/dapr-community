#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr

I served in the Dapr steering committee for over a year, participated in meetings and different votings about the technical direction of the project.
I am actively promoting the Dapr project and community in China to make it more adoptable in that community.

I want to make Dapr work better in serverless environments and invest in performance, specifically cold start optimizations and optimizing the performance of the individual APIs.
