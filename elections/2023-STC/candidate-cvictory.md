#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr

I participated in the Dapr steering committee since its beginning as a bootstrapping member and advocated Dapr inside my organization and community.
I worked on the proposal for a Database API for Dapr based on SQL and JDBC, brought up the early discussions about raw pub/sub and addition of metadata to pub/sub components.
In addition I worked on adding support for MySQL for additional data types and helped with the design of the Configuration building block.

I am actively promoting the Dapr project and community in China to make it more adoptable in that community.

#### Why you are running

I would like to make Dapr easier to use for developers and make sure the general purpose APIs do not restrict several use cases.
