## Overview 
This document describes the bootstrapping process for the Dapr governance committee. The Dapr project has a single governance body called the Steering and Technical Committee (STC). The STC is responsible for the health of the Dapr community and for overall technical oversight.

## Goals and Responsibilities
The initial role of the STC is to instantiate the formal process for Dapr governance and technical oversight. Responsibilities include maintaining the governance framework, code of conduct, communication platforms, and infrastructure resources. From a technical perspective responsibilities include technical oversight, release processes, integration of technologies into the Dapr project and resolution of technical decisions. Most day-to-day work is delegated by the STC to the maintainers of the Dapr repos.

The governance of Dapr is an open, living document, and continues to evolve as the community and project change. In addition to defining the initial governance process, the bootstrap committee strongly believes that it is important to provide a means for iterating the processes defined by the governance committee.  The role of the governance committee is to be a live, responsive body that can refactor and reform as necessary to adapt to a changing project and community.

## Charter

1. Define, evolve, and promote the vision, values, and mission of the Dapr project.
1. Set the overall technical direction and roadmap of the Dapr project.
1. Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including
   project roles and how collaborators become members, approvers, leads, and/or
   administrators.
1. Steward, control access, delegate access, and establish processes regarding
   all Dapr project resources and has the final say in the disposition of
   those resources.
1. Define and evolve the scope of the Dapr community.
1. Receive and handle reports about [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
   violations and maintain confidentiality.
1. Approval of logo changes, significant website updates and marketing campaigns.
1. Establish processes regarding project resources/assets, including artifact repositories, build and test infrastructure, web sites and their domains, blogs, social-media accounts, etc.
1. Review security reports; work with the appropriate technical leads to accept
   or reject the report; maintain the private nature of such reports until
   disclosed to the broader community.
1. Act as the final escalation point and decider for any disputes, issues,
   clarifications, or escalations within the project scope. This includes delegate appropriate authority to trusted individuals.
1. Resolve technical issues, technical disagreements and escalations within the project.
1. Set the priorities of individual releases to ensure coherency and proper sequencing. This includes deciding how and when official releases of Dapr artifacts are made and what they include.
1. Approve the creation/deletion of GitHub repositories, along with other high-level administrative issues around GitHub and our other tools.
1. Establish and maintain the overall technical governance guidelines and processes for the project including a final escalation path.
1. Foster an environment for a healthy and happy community of developers and contributors.

## Committee Meetings

STC meets monthly. Meetings are open to public and held online.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions, for example privacy, private
emails to the committee, code of conduct violations, escalations, disputes
between members, security reports, some meetings are held in private. Committee meetings can be made closed by a simple majority vote of the STC members, but closed meetings do not count towards the required meeting frequency. The governance committee will inform the community if a particular meeting is closed, as well as the general reasons for this, prior to the meeting taking place.

Public meetings are recorded and the [recordings](XX) and [meeting notes](XXX) are available publicly. If a member misses more than 50% of all meetings held within a six month period then they will be removed from the committee and a special election will be held. 

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/Dapr/community/issues), and the STC invites your feedback there. See [Getting in touch](#getting-in-touch) for other options.

## Committee members
To bootstrap the STC 5 individuals were identified to provide the initial process that can bootstrap the remainder of the process.The Bootstrap committee will be replaced by the elected Dapr Committee. 

The current membership of the STC is:

## Decision process

The steering and technical committee desires to always reach consensus.

Decisions requiring a vote include: issuing written governance policy, amending existing written governance policy, all spending, official responses to publicly raised issues, or any other decisions that at least half the members present decide require a vote.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may
pass with at least half the members of the committee supporting it.

Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members are present.

## Composition
Seats on the steering and technical committee are held by an individual, not by their employer. This means that if an individual changes their employer, they retain their seat until the next election. 

The steering and technical committee has 5 seats initially to bootstrap. These 5 seats are contributing seats, open to any project contributor. This is open to expand upto 11 seats for qualifying contributing members as the project expands. There is no timeframe for this expanded committee. 

A maximum of two seats is allowed from any one company. For companies with two seats these are should be filled by one person focused on the vision, values, and mission of the project and another person who is focused on the technical decisions.

Steering Committee members serve for 2-year terms. 

## Election Procedure

### Timeline

STC elections are held every two years. Six weeks or more before the
election, the STC will appoint Election Officer(s) (see below).
Four weeks or more before the election, the Election Officer(s) issue a
call for nominations, publish the list of voters, and open the call for
exceptions. One week before the election the call for nominations and exceptions
will be closed. The election will be open for voting not less than two weeks and
not more than four. The results of the election will be announced within one
week of closing the election. New Steering Committee members will take office on
December 1 of each year.

### Election Officer(s)

Six weeks or more before the election, the STC will appoint
between one and three Election Officer(s) to administer the election. Elections
Officers will be Dapr community members in good standing who are eligible to
vote, are not running for STC in that election, who are not currently part
of the STC and can make a public promise of impartiality. They
will be responsible for:

- Making all announcements associated with the election
- Preparing and distributing electronic ballots
- Judging exception requests
- Assisting candidates in preparing and sharing statements
- Tallying voting results according to the rules in this charter

### Eligibility to Vote

Anyone who has at least 50 contributions in the last 12 months is eligible to
vote in the STC election. Contributions are defined as opening PRs,
reviewing and commenting on PRs, opening and commenting on issues, writing
design docs, commenting on design docs, helping people on Discord, and other efforts that help advance Dapr the project. The eligible voters list is a list of GitHub IDs.


The electoral roll of all eligible voters will be captured at
Dapr/community/elections/$YEAR/voters.md and the votersâ guide will
be captured at Dapr/community/elections/$YEAR/README.md

We are committed to an inclusive process and will adapt future eligibility requirements based on community feedback.

### Candidate Eligibility

Community members must be eligible to vote in order to stand for election. Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by another eligible member. There are no term limits for STC committee members, meaning that a committee member can continue to be elected for new 2 year term ad infinitum.  

To run for a Contributing seat, a candidate must additionally be at least a
project Member as defined in [community-membership](community-membership.md).


### Voting Procedure

Elections will be held using a time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the Schulze method. The top
vote-getters are elected to the available seats, with the exceptions for company
representation discussed below.

### Limitations on Company Representation

No more than two seats may be held by employees of the same organization (or
conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). If the results of an election result in greater than two employees of the same organization, the lowest vote getters from any particular employer will be removed until representation on the committee is down to two.

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a
way that would yield more than 2 seats being held by employees of the same
organization, sufficient members of the committee must resign until only two
employees of the same employer are left. If it is impossible to find sufficient
members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new
special elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for
example evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all
non-involved STC Committee members will decide.

## Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected STC member, the
candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered
the seat, provided that person otherwise qualifies to join the STC. This process
will continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will
be held as soon as possible, unless the regular STC election is less than 7 weeks
away. Eligible voters from the most recent election will vote in the special
election. Eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special
election. Any replacement STC member will serve out the remainder of the term for
the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

## Bootstrap and Transition

In order to bootstrap the STC, 5 seats are allocated in September 2021. Two for Microsoft, two for Alibaba and one for Intel committee members as the current active companies to the project. This can expand up to 11 seats maximum over the coming years.

The next election will be held in November 2023 for all currently filled seats at that time.  

## Changes to the charter

Changes to the STC charter may be proposed via a PR on the charter itself.
Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee as per the
[decision process](#decision-process) outlined above.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of
one week for comments and questions before a vote will occur.

## Authority, Facilitation, and Decision Making in Dapr

Ideally most decisions are made at the lowest possible level within the
project: with repo maintainers. When this is not possible for
technical decisions, the STC can help facilitate a conversation to work through
the contended issue. When facilitation by the STC
does not resolve the contention, the STC may have to make a final decision.

Note that if the STC is called to resolve contended decisions regularly, it is a
symptom of a larger problem in the community that will need to be addressed.

## Getting in touch

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the steering and technical committee at
   [steering.technical@dapr.io](mailto:steering.technica@dapr.io).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on any Dapr repository and indicate that you would like
   attention from the steering and technical committee.
